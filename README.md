# Diabetes-Analysis

### Project Summary: Exploratory Data Analysis on Diabetes Dataset


### Objective:
This project conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a diabetes dataset using SQL for data manipulation. The aim is to gain insights into the relationships between different variables and their impact on diabetes diagnosis. Additionally, we aim to identify patterns, trends, and potential factors contributing to diabetes among patients.


### Data Understanding:
The dataset contains information about patients with diabetes, including features such as age, BMI, glucose levels, insulin levels, skin thickness, blood pressure, and diabetes status.


### Tools and Data Sources:
Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) was utilized for data manipulation and analysis. The primary dataset, "Diabetes.csv" from Meriskill, documents cases of diabetes patients.


### Data Reprocessing:
Checked for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data; none were found.


### Data Import Steps:
- Created a new database named Hospital_DB in SSMS.
- Employed the "Import Flat File" wizard in SSMS for seamless data transfer from CSV files to respective tables within the Hospital database.


### Data Manipulation:
Various SQL queries were executed to analyze the dataset, including counting patients, calculating averages, categorizing patients based on attributes, and analyzing distributions by different factors such as age and outcome.


### Conclusion:
EDA has provided valuable insights into factors influencing diabetes diagnosis and prevalence. These findings can inform targeted interventions, public health initiatives, and personalized healthcare strategies.


### Recommendations:
- Identify key risk factors associated with diabetes.
- Develop early detection strategies using predictive modeling.
- Promote lifestyle interventions for at-risk populations.
- Emphasize regular health screenings and monitoring for better management.
